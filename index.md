# Getting started for Angular

## Setting up Angular 
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Install Angular-Cli via command prompt

  `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## First Angular App

This will setup the angular framework.

`ng new <app name>`

`ng  new my-app`

Finally completed yeah.. Ignoring the deprecated warning… see no evil


Execute `ng serve --open` in your newly created folder. (Don’t make the same mistake as I do below)

Magic in progress


### What does it do?
In my terms: it does magic.
+ ng serve launches the server (eg: http://localhost:4200/ becomes available)
+ ng serve also watches the files, when there is any changes, it will rebuild the project and refreshes the browser
+ `--open` launch the application on your browser

There you go. First angular app up and running.

## My opinion
After searching high and low, dozing off several tutorial videos, I found that **Angular from theory to practice** by [Asim Hussain](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/) is suitable for me to pick Angular from scratch. I start from minimal javascript knowledge. So some introduction about ES6/Typescript help me to pick up Angular faster. Easy to follow short tutorial is useful, as I can code and study at the same time. I learn faster with moving fingers.


Once master the basics, I move to [Angular IO](https://angular.io) to search for more information. It is like a dictionary for angular. However there is not much example given though. I found the documentation about angular best practice is useful for a beginner like me. It is better to start right.


As I work on Angular project, scenario gets tricky. Then I found my dear ex-colleague wrote all the articles that’s solve all my problem. Thanks [Jeceyln](https://scotch.io/@jecelyn)! Only problem is some of her posts are hosted in medium (banned for whoever access via Malaysia internet). I having hard time understanding the article without image. (Sad)
